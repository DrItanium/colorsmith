Colorsmith is a program which takes input and interprets as instructions for a
theoretical processor that outputs color to the Pimoroni PiGlow. Obviously this
requires a raspberry pi.

Because of this, it only works on the raspberry pi and requires a PiGlow as
well as an installation of wiringPi by Gordon Henderson.

You may find that some inputs do nothing for quite a bit of time as delay is
one of the operations.

Colorsmith is an application specific processor with four major commands:

glow1
glowleg
glowring
delay
