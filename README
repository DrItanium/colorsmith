Colorsmith is a program which takes input and interprets as instructions for a
theoretical processor that outputs color to the Pimoroni PiGlow. Obviously this
requires a raspberry pi.

Because of this, it only works on the raspberry pi and requires a PiGlow as
well as an installation of wiringPi by Gordon Henderson.

You may find that some inputs do nothing for quite a bit of time as delay is
one of the operations.

Colorsmith is an application specific processor with four major commands:

glow1
glowleg
glowring
delay

Read the source code for all of the combinations

See what sorts of patterns you get from all sorts of inputs. I've only done arm
code and normal text but soon I want to try ia64, x86, and amd64 code as well.

-------------------------------------------------------------
examples:

./colorsmith < /bin/ls
./colorsmith < Makefile
./colorsmith < colorsmith

The flow program is a separate program which flows bytes onto the piglow from a
given piece of input. It is an experiment in data structures and pointer
arithmetic which I am somewhat bad at in C.
